# Presentation Overview

This presentation systematically explores the relationship between seasonal temperature variations, winter tourism, and avalanche dynamics in Davos, Switzerland. It begins by defining and contrasting the mechanisms behind dry and wet avalanches, setting the stage for a deeper investigation into how climatic factors and human activities converge to influence avalanche occurrences. The presentation carefully details the integration of robust datasets—ranging from NASA MODIS temperature measurements to Swiss tourism statistics—to elucidate the underlying patterns and correlations.

## Impact and Implications

The impact of this work is twofold:

- **Advancing Scientific Understanding:**
  It pinpoints specific temperature thresholds that differentiate avalanche types and reveals subtle links between increased tourism activity and avalanche reporting.

- **Enhancing Public Safety:**
  By translating complex statistical and meteorological analyses into clear visualizations and actionable insights, the presentation not only informs the research community but also serves as a vital resource for developing targeted risk management strategies.

# Avalanche Safety Awareness Initiative

To promote avalanche safety awareness, we launched a two-part educational initiative for mountain visitors and the student body at Institut Le Rosey.

## Part 1: Mountain Outreach

The first part of our campaign focused on engaging individuals directly in high-risk areas. We placed avalanche safety posters at key mountain locations, including:

- Mountain Eggli
- Schönried
- Saanenmöser

Each poster featured a **QR code** linking to an **interactive quiz** designed to test and reinforce knowledge of avalanche safety principles.

This on-site approach allowed us to reach people where avalanche awareness is most critical.
- **14 individuals** completed the quiz via the posters
- **Average score**: **4.3 out of 7**

While this reflects a basic understanding of safety measures, the results also highlight the need for continued education and outreach.

## Part 2: School Engagement

The second part of the initiative extended into the school environment. We shared the avalanche safety quiz with **all students at Institut Le Rosey** to evaluate their level of preparedness.

- **127 students** responded
- **Average score**: **4.6 out of 7**

These results indicate a relatively strong baseline of awareness among the student body, while also identifying opportunities to further strengthen their understanding.

---

Through this initiative, we aimed to foster a more profound **culture of safety** both on and off the mountain. By combining **direct outreach** in ski areas with **educational engagement** at school, we emphasize the importance of **preparedness** and **knowledge** in preventing avalanche-related accidents.

We remain committed to expanding this effort, believing **learning and awareness are essential to saving lives**.

## 🌍 The Importance of Multilingual Content

The public version of the avalanche safety quiz was presented in **four languages** — English, French, German, and Romanian — to ensure **greater inclusivity and accessibility**. Multilingual content:

- Reaches a **wider audience**, including tourists and international visitors.
- Shows **respect for cultural and linguistic diversity**, encouraging engagement.
- Ensures **clear communication of life-saving information** regardless of the user's first language.
- Helps **build trust** by showing that safety efforts are designed for everyone, not just native speakers.

This inclusive approach is especially important in alpine regions like Gstaad and Saanenmöser, which attract skiers and snowboarders from across Europe and beyond.

In contrast, the student version at Institut Le Rosey was delivered **exclusively in English**, the school’s primary language of instruction. Since the target audience shares a common academic language, multilingual translation was not necessary. This streamlined communication while still delivering the same key safety messages effectively within the school environment.

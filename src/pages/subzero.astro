      Project: SubZero-GPT – Interactive Generative Pretrained Transformer
    </h1>

    <p>
      Our project developed a specialized <strong
        >Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)</strong
      > called <strong>SubZero-GPT</strong> designed to provide interactive, context-aware
      responses drawn from a comprehensive corpus of documents created during our
      research. This cutting-edge model not only processes general queries but is
      also fine-tuned with domain-specific data, such as avalanche safety tips and
      our detailed investigation findings, ensuring that users receive reliable and
      precise information tailored to their needs.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>

    <div class="feature">
      <p>
        <strong>Interactive Q&A:</strong><br />
        Users can ask questions in natural language, and the system dynamically references
        our extensive repository of documents to deliver accurate, context-specific
        answers.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
      <p>
        <strong>Domain Expertise:</strong><br />
        By integrating avalanche safety guidelines and our investigative reports,
        the GPT model offers specialized insights, making it a valuable tool for
        both experts and the general public.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
      <p>
        <strong>Comprehensive Resource Integration:</strong><br />
        The model leverages a wide array of data—from procedural safety tips to in-depth
        analytical reports—to support robust, multifaceted responses that address
        a variety of queries.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
      <p>
        <strong>User-Centric Design:</strong><br />
        Emphasis has been placed on creating an intuitive interface that makes the
        technology accessible, ensuring that even non-technical users can benefit
        from our research without needing prior knowledge of the underlying systems.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Project Impact</h2>
    <p>
      This project not only showcases the practical applications of
      state-of-the-art natural language processing but also demonstrates our
      commitment to disseminating critical safety information and detailed
      investigative outcomes in an engaging, accessible format.
